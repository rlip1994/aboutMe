									<p>Every human is an artist. And this is the main art that we have: <br/> the creation of our story.<br> <b>-Miguel Ruiz</b></p>

								<p>My names is Alex André Solís Barrantes and I was born in December 31st, 1994. At the age of 2 I was diagnosed with polyneuropathy, an illness that causes continuous decrease in my ability to move and feel my body, but that neverstopped me. This condition taught me how to see the world in a different way. <br><br>
									When I was 4 years old, I touched my first computer and I had a lot of questions.My teacher said, “this machine is a magic box, with it you can create a world with knowledge, imagination and math”. Seconds later, I knew my calling, I wanted to create that kind of magic. <br><br>
									With the continuous growing of my passion five years later I was able to create my first program, a “hello world” in BASIC language. I learned BASIC with “Game Programming for Teens”,but I don’t recommend this book  to start with as it is really complicated. However, I used it to improve myself and it was my first weapon to start becoming a programmer. <br><br>
									At the age of 16 I did my first Motivational speech in front of a crowd, I was really nervous and scared of public speaking, but my fear didn&#39;t stop me, I went out and did my best. They were students with a thousand eyes looking at me, but it brought me comfort to give them a good message of positivity. Ever since then, I have been learning so many things from the over 25 speeches I have given around the country and all of them have helped me grow as a human being. <br> <br>
									When I reached my 20th Birthday, on December 31st, I started worrying about choosing a career that matched my goals, interests and my physical abilities. I started thinking of how I could start paving the way to work on something that I love. I realized that I like math &amp; solving problems and a perfect career for that would be: Software Engineer. I studied as never before to be admitted at the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, and I suceded. <br><br>
									When I was 22 years old, I started my first job as Developer of Cyber Security Software at Intel. During this time, I learned so much about Cyber Security and other technologies and frameworks like C++, angular and teamcity. At Intel, they helped me with physical therapy and did everything necessary for my needs to be met comfortably so that I could be in full potential at work. <br><br>
									Continuing with my Career Growth, in May of 2018 I moved to work in the department of innovation at	Intel where I’m currently working on developing new projects to support other companies to innovate, improve and create new products that help grow Intel and Costa Rica.<br> <br><br>
									That's a little bit about my story if someone wants to know more about me <a href="https://medium.com/@delfinomachin/alex-andr%C3%A9-va-por-la-vida-desafiando-todo-1a367491be2c">click here</a>.</p>
